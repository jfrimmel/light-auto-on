/// The panic handler of the application.
///
/// Normally, one would fill this panic handler with a reset, a flashing LED or
/// similar. But this project aims to avoid using panics altogether. Therefore
/// this panic handler should (in theory) not be necessary as it is never called
/// by Rust. But: the [`core`]-crate requires the function to be provided by a
/// `![no_std]`-binary. Therefore this function contains a body, that will not
/// compile (in reality: will not link) the application due to a missing symbol.
/// If there is any (potentially) reachable panic (i.e. one, that the optimizer
/// could not get rid of), an error like this is shown to the user:
/// ```console
/// src/main.rs:63:(.text.rust_begin_unwind+0x0): undefined reference to `a_panic_is_reachable'
/// ```
/// This indicates, that there is a possibly panicking call and shows even the
/// line number (63 in this case).
